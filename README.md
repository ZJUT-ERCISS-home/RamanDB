# ZJUT-RamanDB:Multi-classification, cross-device Raman database
Raman spectroscopy has become one of the main methods for substance detection, but its application depends on a universal Raman database. At present, the existing open Raman database has a single material type and integration time, and can not meet the needs of cross-device matching and identification, which limits the application of Raman spectroscopy technology in cross-field and cross-device. This led us to design and publish a comprehensive cross-device Raman database of more than 4,500 spectral data points for 132 substances, known as ZJUT-RamanDB.
## Goal of Database
The purpose of this database is to provide data support for cross-device matching identification of Raman substances and flexible application of multi-scenario equipment. It is acceptable to use this database to develop new technologies, methods, algorithms or systems for Raman substance detectionã€‚

## Raman spectral data preprocessing method
Conventional Raman spectra often contain noise and fluorescence, which will affect the subsequent spectral matching process. In order to ensure the quality of the collected Raman signals, after de-noising and limiting correction of the collected Raman spectral data, the Savitzky-Golay convolutional smoothing algorithm and airPLS algorithm are used for de-noising and baseline correction respectively
